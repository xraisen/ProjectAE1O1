## 💡 QUICK BUILD TIPS FOR DEVELOPER

1. **Reusable components:** Contact form, CTA buttons, testimonial cards can be templates
2. **Maps:** Use Google Maps API (familiar to most) or Mapbox for more control
3. **Forms:** Keep initial forms short (5-10 fields max) – expand on confirmation page
4. **Images:** Invest in 8-12 professional photos per segment (nurses see hospitals, families see schools/yards)
5. **Mobile:** Test every page on actual mobile device, not just DevTools
6. **Testimonials:** Video is nice but not required – real quotes are sufficient
7. **Typography:** Large, readable fonts (many older users, rural internet)
8. **CTAs:** Use action words: "Check Availability," "Call Now," "Schedule Tour"
9. **Disclaimers:** Legal review recommended for "Subject to availability" language
10. **Forms:** Send confirmation email immediately + phone follow-up within 2 hours
